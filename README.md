RandomMathProblems
==================

Perl modules to generate randomized math problems of various types. The idea is that each module generates problems of a certain type, but with the specific numbers involved chosen randomly. So that every student an be given a set of problems different from everyone else's, to avoid the problem of some students copying other students' answers.
